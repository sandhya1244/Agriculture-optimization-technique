# Agriculture-optimization-technique
This is a kind of agriculture optimization technique where i built machine learning predictive model which gives result us that which crops is suitable for you according 
to your soil and climatic condition

Machine Learning is well equipped when it comes to analyzing data regarding soil conditions, including moisture level, temperature, and chemical makeup, all of which have an impact upon crop growth and livestock well-being.

Today in agriculture, this can allow crops to be grown at much higher precision, enabling farmers to treat plants and animals almost individually, which in turn significantly increases the effectiveness of farmers' decisions.

Using this can develop means to even predict harvest yields and evaluate crop quality for individual plant species to detect crop disease and weed infestations which were previouly impossible!
